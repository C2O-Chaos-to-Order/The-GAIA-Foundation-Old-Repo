# SIM-AL-FOR-D - iteration 5 SPEC

Written before execution. The parameters are the JSON block below (hashed as `params_sha256` in EXECUTION_RECORD.json; this file's bytes as `spec_sha256`).

## Purpose
N = 3 (smallest N for Eq. 4): does the exact x* match Eq. 4 at weak selection?

## Phase operationalization tested
FOR Allegiance = how large a basin a conforming convention needs to take over (P58).

## Sources this run draws on
P58 (Ohtsuki, Bordalo & Nowak 2007, 'The one-third law of evolutionary dynamics', J Theor Biol; Harvard DASH, read in full in ALB): Moran fixation probability with f = 1 - w + w F, Eq. 4 finite-N weak-selection condition (N - 2)a + (2N - 1)b > (N + 1)c + (2N - 4)d, Discussion: the required basin of attraction grows from 2/3 (Nw << 1) toward 1 (large Nw).

## Refinement from previous iteration
First iteration of this run family in this cycle.

## Pre-registered checks
| id | kind | expectation |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | validation | see SPEC |
| H1 | hypothesis | Nw < 0.1: exact critical x* within 0.01 of P58 Eq. 4 |
| R1 | reporting | values |

Kinds: *validation* = code/analytic correctness (must Pass); *hypothesis* = substantive test that may go either way (Supported / Not supported; 'Not supported' is a finding, not an error); *reporting* = value recorded.

## Limits
Deterministic.Statistical tolerance (owner standard, set before running): Monte Carlo validation checks use a band of 4 standard errors computed from the run itself; deterministic checks use explicit numerical bounds.
