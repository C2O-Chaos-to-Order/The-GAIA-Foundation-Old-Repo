# SIM-CV-SOC-D - iteration 12 SPEC

Written before execution. The parameters are the JSON block below (hashed as `params_sha256` in EXECUTION_RECORD.json; this file's bytes as `spec_sha256`).

## Purpose
Small groups in the unbiased-median context (n 2-4).

## Phase operationalization tested
SOC Convergence = collective estimation (P69).

## Sources this run draws on
P69 (Almaatouq, Rahimian, Burton & Alhajri 2022, 'The distribution of initial estimates moderates the effect of social influence on the wisdom of the crowd', Sci Rep 12:16546, PMC9530231, CC BY; read in full in CV0, SI not read): a_n(omega) = omega a_1 + (1 - omega) mean; Omega_n; Fig. 2 (n 50, theta 2, omega 1/3, log-normal): centralization helps under overestimation or large dispersion, hurts under low-dispersion underestimation.

## Refinement from previous iteration
First iteration of this run family in this cycle.

## Pre-registered checks
| id | kind | expectation |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | validation | omega = 0 gives Omega exactly 0 |
| H1 | hypothesis | unbiased-median context (mu 0, sigma 1): Omega > 0.5 already at n = 4 |
| R1 | reporting | values |

Kinds: *validation* = code/analytic correctness (must Pass); *hypothesis* = substantive test that may go either way (Supported / Not supported; 'Not supported' is a finding, not an error); *reporting* = value recorded.

## Limits
Monte Carlo. Statistical tolerance (owner standard, set before running): Monte Carlo validation checks use a band of 4 standard errors computed from the run itself; deterministic checks use explicit numerical bounds. New kinds/options in CVD (stats_audit, instrument_core, levelling_voter bias_mode=selection) were smoke-tested once at trivial size (seed 99, temporary directory, nothing kept) with printed values suppressed; existing kinds were not smoke-tested. CVC results were known when these hypotheses were written (replications say so).
