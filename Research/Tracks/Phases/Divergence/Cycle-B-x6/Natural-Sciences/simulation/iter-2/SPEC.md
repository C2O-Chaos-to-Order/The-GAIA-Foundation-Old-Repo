# SIM-DV-NAT-B - iteration 2 SPEC

Written before execution. The parameters are the JSON block below (hashed as `params_sha256` in EXECUTION_RECORD.json; this file's bytes as `spec_sha256`).

## Purpose
Same linkage model with weaker selection (s = 0.03, s/m = 3) to see whether the island shrinks or vanishes when selection is weak relative to gene flow.

## Phase operationalization tested
As iteration 1.

## Sources this run draws on
As iteration 1.

## Refinement from previous iteration
Iteration 1 used s = 0.1; only s and seed change.

## Pre-registered checks
| id | kind | expectation |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | validation | neutral mean frequency 0.5 within 4 SE |
| H1 | hypothesis | Fst(c=0) - Fst(c=0.5) > 4 SE |
| H2 | hypothesis | monotone in c |
| H3 | hypothesis | Fst(c=0.01) below midpoint |
| R1 | reporting | Fst by c |

Kinds: *validation* = code/analytic correctness (must Pass); *hypothesis* = substantive test that may go either way (Supported / Not supported; 'Not supported' is a finding, not an error); *reporting* = value recorded.

## Limits
As iteration 1. Statistical tolerance (owner standard, set before running): Monte Carlo validation checks use a band of 4 standard errors computed from the run itself (two-sided; false-alarm probability about 6e-5 per check under a correct implementation); deterministic checks use explicit numerical bounds.
